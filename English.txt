1. Initial Amount
When you fund your trading account, this is not a payment in the actual sense.
Many customers assume that the minimum amount for the investment represents a payment for opening the account — however, this is not correct.
With this amount, you merely make a transfer from your bank account to your personal trading account.
It is and remains your money — we do not retain a single cent of it.
Our interest lies exclusively in your profit.
We receive a commission in the amount of 10% — but only on the profit that was generated in your trading account.
And even this commission is only deducted when you withdraw your profits.
Until that point, you incur no costs whatsoever.



2. “I will start investing next week” – why postponing can cost a fortune
Many potential investors tell themselves: “I will start next week.”
This seemingly harmless sentence is in reality a classic form of procrastination which, according to financial experts, can cost tens of thousands of euros in the long term — primarily due to the effect of compound interest.
Private investors often postpone entering the market. They wait for the “right moment” or avoid the decision altogether. However, the numbers clearly show: time is the most valuable asset when investing.
Even a delay of just one year can significantly reduce the final value of a portfolio.
With an average annual return of 8–10% (historical average of the stock markets), a delayed start of just one year can cost 10–15% of the possible gains in the long term — calculated over 20 to 30 years.
Example: An investment of €10,000 can grow to over €200,000 in 30 years. If the start is delayed by one year, losses amounting to several tens of thousands of euros occur.
“Investment procrastination is one of the greatest enemies of wealth building,” financial advisors emphasize.
Studies show that many people hesitate because they fear losses, feel insecure, or believe they must first save more capital. In reality, it is sufficient to start with small, regular amounts — for example through Philippos Asset Management.
Experts recommend: start small, automate deposits, and ignore short-term market fluctuations.
Market history proves that it is not those who invest who lose — but those who wait too long.
The most important step is the first one: activate your account today.
Because, as compound interest shows, every week of delay means real money that is lost forever.


3. “If this really worked, everyone would be rich” – a look behind the myths of the investment world
I hear this argument more often than any question about risks or strategies.
It usually sounds calm, almost philosophical — as if it were meant to end the conversation. In reality, however, it explains nothing. It merely removes from the person the responsibility to make a decision.
I often use a simple example that everyone understands. Go outside and look around: there are significantly more people who are overweight than people in good physical shape. At the same time, fitness studios are everywhere, information is freely available, trainers are accessible, and training plans can be found within a few minutes.
Does that mean that sport “does not work”? Of course not.
It is not the gym that produces results, but the person’s decision and their willingness to act regularly. For some, it is comfortable to live as they have before. Others explain their results with genetics, lack of time, or stress. That too is a decision — even if often an unconscious one.
With investments, it is exactly the same. The financial markets are open, the instruments are available, and the rules are known. Yet only a few are truly prepared to earn money. Not because it is impossible, but because it requires discipline, patience, and the ability to withstand short-term pressure.
Here another parallel to sport becomes apparent: only a few achieve their goals alone. Most of those who achieve real results work with a coach. Not out of weakness, but because they know that the path without experience and an external perspective is longer and more expensive.
In the investment field, this role is taken on by a stock market expert who has already walked this path. We do not take the work away from you, but we help to avoid typical mistakes and not to give up at the first difficulties. This significantly increases the chances of sustainable success.
So when someone says, “If this really worked, everyone would be rich,” I think of something else.
Not of whether the market works — but of whether a person is prepared to make a decision and take action. Because it works. And those who understand it actually earn.
The only question is: why not you yet?


4. Reviews in the investment sector: help or trap for beginners?
When choosing an investment company, most people first pay attention to reviews and testimonials. This seems logical: if others are satisfied, trust appears justified. Behind this often lies the desire for security and the fear of making a wrong decision. But this is exactly where the first risk begins.
Anyone who relies exclusively on the opinion of others gives up making their own conscious decision. This can lead to a truly suitable offer being overlooked, while a questionable one is accepted without deep understanding. The same company can trigger completely different reactions among different customers — this is normal, because goals, expectations, and strategies are never the same.
Another important point is the credibility of reviews. No one can say with certainty where genuine experiences end and where emotions, exaggerations, or even paid texts begin. In investing, the result depends not only on the company, but also on the investor’s decisions — a factor that is often not mentioned in reviews.
Therefore, testimonials should serve only as additional orientation, but not as the basis for a decision. It is far more reliable to examine a company thoroughly: to understand the approach, ask questions, and assess whether it truly fits one’s own goals.
Real security does not arise from comments on the internet, but from comprehensible criteria — transparent documentation, clear conditions, strong partners, and a verifiable market presence.
However, final understanding only arises through one’s own experience, when one begins the cooperation and sees how everything works in practice.


5. IP telephony: why companies call from multiple numbers
Insight from stock market expert Olaf Klein
When customers ask why calls from a company come from different telephone numbers, I first try to take away the concern. In most cases, this is neither a mistake nor anything suspicious, but a completely normal practice of modern companies. Behind this is the use of IP telephony — a technology that has long since become the standard for companies operating systematically and internationally.
IP telephony works via the internet and enables the use of virtual phone numbers that are not tied to a specific telephone or office. This creates flexibility: employees can be reachable from different locations, and customers receive a response more quickly. For me, this is above all a question of convenience and stable communication. If the load on one line increases, the system automatically distributes the calls further so that no connection is lost.
Another advantage is intelligent call forwarding. Inquiries can arrive directly at the right contact person or the responsible department — without unnecessary transfers. This saves time and increases service quality.
I always say: good communication is not measured by the number of calls, but by how quickly and correctly someone receives an answer.
Especially with international contacts, IP telephony enables the use of local phone numbers. This reduces costs for the company, which in turn creates more room for investment in service and further development.
So if you receive calls from different numbers, you should understand this as a sign of modern technology — not as a reason for concern. In most cases, this stands for well-organized processes, customer orientation, and the claim to make communication as pleasant as possible.
